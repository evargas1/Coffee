    <h2>Family Owned</h2>
    <p>We started out making coffee for our local friends in the community and they encouraged to take into consideration opening a local cafe for everyone in the neighbohood to enjoy. So me and my husband along with my sister in law go together to talk about this idea we had to help the community too. We went to local places here and spoke to some of the owners to as to what challenges they had to overcome in opening their own family owned place. They offered us practical advice that we are still applying today. They encouraged us to make showing love to the community our priotory because they would love and supoort us in return. How true those words proved to be!</p>

    <h2>Chicago</h2>
    <p>Why Chicago of all places. My parents are orignally from a small village in Mexico and they moved to Chicago in their early twenties viewing it as the land of opptunity for their children. Me and my husbandbothe grew up in Chicago and its our home it always will be. Endurance results from living in this city for so long but that endurance crosses over to every aspect of life so really we all need it and Chicago is notourious for knocking people down and watching them get back up. All you have to do is be willing to risk it all. </p>

    <h2>Thank You</h2>
    
    <p>We did not expect that our coffee would touch the heart of so many Chicago natives who have lived here the whole life. We have seen first hand how coffee can bring people together. That is why we have made it our mission to expand our brand all over Chicago and expand our love has been our priotory. We hope that Chicago will continue to show us love and support, as we make these big leaps of faith. Thank you to the community for giving us the wings to fly and reach our dreams.</p>
